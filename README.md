# Call_Weather_DarkSkyAPI

This is a small app that can be run on localhost that calls the DarkSkyWeather API based on the recorded spoken sentence: 'weather please'.
The app finds the current location of the device that is running the app and prints out degree fahrenheit and if its currently cloudy, sunny or rainy.

Based on Wes Bos 30 day Javascript tutorial https://javascript30.com/
